### My Favorite Batman Persona
It's not even close for me. When it comes to the Batman persona itself, Robert Pattinson defeats other batman depictions. There are four main reasons. first His detective skills are far more powerful than a strong punch. The previous Batmen would have lost to the riddler half way through the movie. Second, His voice isn't annoying like the overly hoarse Bale, or the unrealistic tech Affleck. Third, his relationships between Gordon and Batwoman are depicted the best of any other movie. They work together and help move plot in the right direction. Christian Bale's Gordon only complicates the plot. Fourth, He creates his own gear which is realistic and intuitive.

### Briliant Writing with Dark World Building
One of the main reasons why this story is so effective, is that it intertwines with it's world building and character development. While the Batman and Gordon are solving the Riddler's clues, they are also developing their relationship through finding more details about Gotham's corruption. While the Batman and Catwoman try and stop Falcone, their characters develop through meeting with the Penguin and other corrupt politicians who are also tied into the plot with the Riddler. It all blends together in a cohesive way. 

The cinematography nailed the "dark" aspect much better than the "dark knight" movie. You could feel the grittiness and dirtiness of the streets. Even when it was daytime, you could steel feel the darkness. Robert Pattinson exemplifies the dark tone of the movie through his brilliant acting. 

Having Robert Pattinson narrate the movie was a strong choice and I loved. The reason I loved it is because you saw the world in the eyes of Bruce Wayne. Quite a few were annoyed with how you saw very little of Bruce, which is true. But his narration caused the viewer to see inside Bruce's head. Which, in times, is better than him just speaking.

Another brilliant part of the movie was having us believe that the Riddler knew who the Batman was. Even in the scene when the Batman was at the insane asylum with the Riddler, he starts to think "Is this it? Is my identity gone?". But the Riddler did not actually know the secret identity at all. He just didn't 

### Actors selection was flawless... Almost
Every Actress and Actor was casted wonderfully. All were exceptional especially Colin Farrel who you'd be surprised was the Penguin. Paul Dano (the Riddler) portrayed a talented multi-faceted serial killer. His motivations and intentions were clear in the movie and I never thought of him as one-dimensional, like most superhero villains. There were only two miscasts: Thomas Wayne & Falcone. I didn't feel that those actors really fit with the character. 

### Could've been a little better
I wish they focused more on the story of Martha Wayne's psychological history. It's something that could've enhanced Bruce Wayne's background. There's no man in his right mind who would want to become the Batman. So maybe Bruce is just a little crazy due to his mama. Whether or not that's true, it would have been something worth getting into.

The third act struggled with the Arena scene. It was a dull fight scene along with anti-climatic action. The only part I love about the arena scene was when they were asking questions to one of Riddler's men, and they said "I am vengeance". You can see Robert Pattinson's great acting with his eyes. He didn't have to say anything, his eyes showed his disappointment in himself as he realized his negative influence.

### Verdict
This is the second best Batman movie of all time. It gives a unique and never-before-seen take on the Batman and Gotham.
