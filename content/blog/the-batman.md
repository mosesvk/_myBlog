### my Favorite Batman
It's not even close for me. When it comes to the Batman persona itself, Robert Pattinson defeats other batman depictions. There are four main reasons. first His detective skills are far more powerful than a strong punch. The previous Batmen would have lost to the riddler half way through the movie. Second, His voice isn't annoying like the overly hoarse Bale, or the unrealistic tech Affleck. Third, his relationships between Gordon and Batwoman are the depicted the best of any other movie. Fourth, He creates his own gear which is realistic and intuitive. 

### Briliant Writing

### Darker than the Dark Knight

### the Riddler is for real

### Verdict
