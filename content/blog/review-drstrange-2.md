### Plot - an Undermining Mess
Multiverse of Madness follows the events of Spiderman: No Way Home. Although, there is no way of you knowing anything of it's consequences. It is also a sequel to the first Dr. Strange, of which we give little nods to here and there. Which makes sense because so much has happened since then (2016). Surprisingly, there are big connections to Avengers: Infinity War. This was the only connection that helped the plot's purpose. Dr. Strange gave up the time stone to Thanos, and because of that, Wanda's Destroying Vision made no difference. Thanos still won, and she had to see Vision die all over again.

But WandaVision really could've been the story to help skyrocket this plot. That series, in my opinion, was a masterpiece. It's storyline and character development were strong and consistent. Wanda was a multi-faceted character who was going through pain and grief. But Multiverse of Madness only gives a five second nod to WandaVision in Dr. Strange and Wanda's conversation at the fake orchard, which was also already shown in the trailer. 

Doctor Strange's storyline was done well and consistent. In the first movie he was learning how "it's not about you..." from the Ancient One. He had to humble himself and surrender his pride to fully grasp his power potential. In this movie, Doctor Strange had learned of the hypocrisies of his other variants. 

Ponytail Strange was willing to sacrifice an innocent America Chavez for the fate of the universe. Illuminati Strange used the darkhold to save his universe yet caused an incursion which destroyed another universe. <span id='italic'>Three Eyed</span> Strange used the Darkhold to search for a Christine. All of these different Strange's had a purpose, and that purpose was to <span class='emphasis'>teach our Dr. Strange two valuable lessons</span>.

Lesson 1, He was becoming so emotionally detached. When you destroy a whole universe or try to kill an innocent girl for the sake of saving your own universe, you have already crossed to the dark side. Wanda did the same thing but she was too emotionally invested. She needed to let go while Doctor Strange wouldn't hesitate to kill someone as long as he thought it was for a good purpose. 



### Wanda or Scarlet?-
