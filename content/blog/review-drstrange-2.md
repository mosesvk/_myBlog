### Undermining Mess
Multiverse of Madness follows the events of Spiderman: No Way Home. Although, there is no way of you knowing anything of it's consequences. It is also a sequel to the first Dr. Strange, of which we give little nods to here and there. Which makes sense because so much has happened since then (2016). Surprisingly, there are big connections to Avengers: Infinity War. This was the only connection that helped the plot's purpose. Dr. Strange gave up the time stone to Thanos, and because of that, Wanda's Destroying Vision made no difference. Thanos still won, and she had to see Vision die all over again.

But WandaVision really could've been the story to help skyrocket this plot. That series, in my opinion, was a masterpiece. It's storyline and character development were strong and consistent. Wanda was a multi-faceted character who was going through pain and grief. But Multiverse of Madness only gives a five second nod to WandaVision in Dr. Strange and Wanda's conversation at the fake orchard, which was also already shown in the trailer. 

Doctor Strange's storyline was done well and consistent. In the first movie he was learning how "it's not about you..." from the Ancient One. He had to humble himself and surrender his pride to fully grasp his power potential. In this movie, Doctor Strange had learned of the hypocrisies of his other variants. 

Ponytail Strange was willing to sacrifice an innocent America Chavez for the fate of the universe. Illuminati Strange used the darkhold to save his universe yet caused an incursion which destroyed another universe. <span id='italic'>Three Eyed</span> Strange used the Darkhold to search for a Christine. All of these different Strange's had a purpose, and that purpose was to <span class='emphasis'>teach our Dr. Strange two valuable lessons</span>.

<span class='emphasis'>Lesson 1,</span> He was becoming so emotionally detached. When you destroy a whole universe or try to kill an innocent girl for the sake of saving your own universe, you have already crossed to the dark side. Wanda did the same thing but she was too emotionally invested. She needed to let go while Doctor Strange wouldn't hesitate to kill someone as long as he thought it was for a good purpose. 

<span class='emphasis'>Lesson 2,</span>, He cannot always be the only one to save the day. Like Christine told him, "You always had to be the one holding the knife". In the end, Doctor Strange relied on America Chavez and encouraged her to believe in herself instead of usually relying on himself. 


### Wanda vs. Scarlet?
The writers of Multiverse of Madness either did not watch WandaVision or they only watched the end credit scene. In that that scene, the darkhold starts to influence Wanda. The movie only credits this scene. It forgets about the whole series explaining what got her to that point. She came to peace about Vision and her sons being gone. But all of a sudden it seems like we rewinded to the beginning of WandaVision.

### Nice but Not Needed 

The Illuminati was only brought to the movie for two reasons: for fan service and to show how powerful and evil Wanda has become... But why? We already know Wanda is incredibly strong from WandaVision. We see her create a completely different reality with ease. Yes, the reveal of John Krasinski and John Stewart was epic, but their immediate demise to Scarlet Witch was a waste. It deflates the excitement of possibily seeing them in a future Fantastic Four or X-MEN movie. I also thought the actors and actresses for the illuminati didn't really stand out to me. Yes that's including Mr. Fantastic and Professor X. I guess part of it was the small screen time, But it just wasn't memorable for me. 

I also thought America Chavez was not really needed for the story. It seemed like she was a requirement by Marvel to check boxes. She was a damsel in distress for most of the movie. She eventually started to figure out her power which was nice, but I would rather dive deeper into Dr. Strange's variants or Wanda's struggle against Scarlet Witch. 


### the Visual Spectacle - 
If there was one flawless aspect of this movie, it would be the imagery and VFX.
