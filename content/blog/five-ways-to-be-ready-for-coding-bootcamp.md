##### Feeling nervous for your upcoming bootcamp? Or are you deciding what date you should you should start? As a former bootcamp grad, I give five essential tips that will guarantee your success as a software developer. 

#### 1. Three Month Fundamentals 
I strongly encourage you to take around 3 months before the bootcamp to study the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. DO NOT waste time in the bootcamp learning concepts that you can easily learn on your own. 

Sources like [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) & [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) are great to get started. And even Youtube is an effective tool to use, yet easy to get distracted.
 
I studied for 5 months before my coding bootcamp and I still wish that I could've studied a little longer. Just remember, do not waste time and money learning only the basics at a coding bootcamp. 

#### 2. Polish Your Typing

If you are not comfortable with your own typing skills, don't fret. Typing is a very attainable skill for most programmers. I used to type around 25 WPM before I started to learn to code. Took only around 1-2 months to get up to 80 WPM. 

#### 3. Set up your Coding Environment
Make sure to set up your IDE (Integrated Developing Environment). Most bootcamps will use Visual Studio Code (VScode for short), but there are plenty other options for this. 

#### 4. Social Media is Vital 



#### 5. Save up
