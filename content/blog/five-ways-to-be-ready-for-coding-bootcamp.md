##### Feeling nervous for your upcoming bootcamp? Or are you deciding what date you should you should start? As a former bootcamp grad, I give five essential tips that will guarantee your success as a software developer.

#### 1. Three Month Fundamentals

Take around 3 months before the bootcamp to study the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. DO NOT waste time in the bootcamp learning concepts that you can easily learn on your own.

Sources like [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) & [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) are great to get started. And even Youtube is an effective tool to use, yet easy to get distracted.

I studied for 5 months before my coding bootcamp and I still wish that I could've studied a little longer. Just remember, do not waste time and money learning only the basics at a coding bootcamp.

#### 2. Polish Your Typing

If you are not comfortable with your own typing skills, don't fret. Typing is an attainable skill by anyone. I used to type around 20 WPM before I started to learn to code. Took only around 1-2 months to get up to 60 WPM.

Here are a list of free typing resources:

<ul>

<li><a href='https://www.typingclub.com/'>Typingclub.com</a></li>
<li><a href='https://www.ratatype.com/'>Ratatype.com</a></li>
</ul>

#### 3. Set up your Coding Environment

Make sure to set up your IDE (Integrated Developing Environment). Most bootcamps will use Visual Studio Code (VScode for short), but there are plenty other options for this.

#### 4. Save up

Financial burden can either be a hinderance or a blessing during your time at a bootcamp. If it is a burden, then you will not be performing your best.

Save up enough money beforehand so that you can focus on your bootcamp full-time. There are those who can work on the side, but I would encourage you to avoid that at all possible if you can. You will want to focus all of your time and attention to coding so that by the end you can be job ready.

#### 5. Social Media is Vital for Networking

Your ultimate goal is to find a job. The best way to do that is to NETWORK. LinkedIn is a great platform to connect with people who know about job opportunities. candidates who are referred from an employee are 55% faster to hire[^3].
