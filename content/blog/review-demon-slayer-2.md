### Lived up to the Hype
Following the fantastic season 1 and amazing Mugen Train arc, the Entertainment arc continues to flourish with it's detailed story telling and flowing animation. This season, although only 11 episodes, adds a similar yet unique take on Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Innosuke's journey. You can feel the tension with every episode building on the last. Although there a bits of pieces that could've been improved, this season as a whole delivers a meaningful and mind-bending experience. 

The story enhances every character's development through trial and discovery. The fight scenes do not dissapoint. Along with the visuals, the music and sound effects add to the marvelous picture. Seeing Tanjiro and Nezuko grow in this series was awesome. They didn't only grow stronger but their courage and determination grew. Their relationship enhanced while also helping the plot.
