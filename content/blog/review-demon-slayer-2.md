### Lived up to the Hype
Following the fantastic season 1 and amazing Mugen Train arc, the Entertainment arc continues to flourish with it's detailed story telling and flowing animation. This season, although only 11 episodes, adds a similar yet unique take on Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Innosuke's journey. You can feel the tension with every episode building on the last. Although there a bits of pieces that could've been improved, this season as a whole delivers a meaningful and mind-bending experience. 

The story enhances every character's development through trial and discovery. The fight scenes do not dissapoint. Along with the visuals, the music and sound effects add to the marvelous picture. Seeing Tanjiro and Nezuko grow in this series was awesome. They didn't only grow stronger but their courage and determination grew. Their relationship enhanced while also helping the plot. 

### Villianous Beast

Gyutaro & Daki are great villains with a great story which enhance this season's plot. Great backstory on the last episode. I love when a movie or show takes a villain and gets the viewer to feel compassion towards their story. Looking at the upper 6 backstory, you come to understand their motives. You are actually put in their shoes and see why that they made the decisions they made. But what Demon Slayer did great with Gyutaro is that they didn't make him redeemable, but understandable. Gyutaro even admits in the show that he doesn't regret the decision he made and that he would've made the decision over and over again. But seeing how he did it all for his sister was truly heart-felt.

### Teamwork made the Dream work
Although Tengen Uzui is not as strong as Rengoku, he was able to work well together with the main trio. Tanjiro did a valiant job at first fighting Daki but the others came to save the day just in time. All characters had a critical part in helping defeat upper moon 6. The last seven episodes were non stop fighting. Each episode, the demon slayers

### Slow Start
Unlike the first season, this season developed slow from the start. Little progress was done to the plot during the first half. I feel that the writers tried to deepen the relationship between Tanjiro and his allies during these beginning episodes. But instead, it only prolonged the plot and character development

### Final Fight Delivers 
This fight was on another level.
