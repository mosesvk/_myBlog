### My Favorite Batman Persona
It's not even close for me. When it comes to the Batman persona itself, Robert Pattinson defeats other batman depictions. There are four main reasons. first His detective skills are far more powerful than a strong punch. The previous Batmen would have lost to the riddler half way through the movie. Second, His voice isn't annoying like the overly hoarse Bale, or the unrealistic tech Affleck. Third, his relationships between Gordon and Batwoman are depicted the best of any other movie. They work together and help move plot in the right direction. Christian Bale's Gordon only complicates the plot. Fourth, He creates his own gear which is realistic and intuitive.

### Idris Elba & John Cena Show
Peacemaker & Bloodsport stole the show.
