### Twists & Turns
Moon Knight's episode one is the best opening in any marvel short series. You see the world through Steven's point of view throughout most of the episode. I love the scenes where he switches to another personality when he gets in trouble with Harrow's men. Every episode carefully lays details details for future episodes.

### Oscar's for Oscar
Oscar Isaac is my favorite part of this show. I would not care much for the show if he wasn't in it. He does a great job playing three different personalities to the point where I believe they are three different people. When Steven assumably dies in episode four, I believed a real person died and that was thanks to Oscar's awesome performance. I hope he receives some serious recognition for this performance. 

### Moon Knight is not about the Hero
Moon Knight hardly reveals the actual superhero of whom the show is named after. Marc's suit was the only one I was interested in, yet, Steven was the only personality I liked.
