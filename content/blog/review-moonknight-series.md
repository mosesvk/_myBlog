> You have to go down a lot of wrong paths to find the Right one
<cite>Not sure who said this</cite>

Hope this helps someone who is in search of the right career path in their life. This is not strictly for a career path in tech, but about the process of failing and retrying. Looking back on my journey, There were four key concepts that have guided me to my career path. Knowing the true meaning of education, Finding what I love to do trial and failure, Deciding to be decisive, and finding purpose in your work has truly guided me to my career path in Tech

### Education vs. Learning 
Going to University was a great experience for me. But none of that experience was beneficial to my learning.

Well there's a huge difference.
