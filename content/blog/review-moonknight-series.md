### Twists & Turns
Hope this helps someone who is in search of the right career path in their life. This is not strictly for a career path in tech, but about the process of failing and retrying. Looking back on my journey, There were four key concepts that have guided me to my career path. Knowing the true meaning of education, Finding what I love to do trial and failure, Deciding to be decisive, and finding purpose in your work has truly guided me to my career path in Tech

### Oscar's for Oscar
Oscar Isaac is my favorite part of this show. I would care much for the show if he wasn't it's center piece. I truly believe that Mark, Steven and Jake are completely different people.

### Education vs. Learning 
Going to University was a great experience for me. But none of that experience was beneficial to my learning. Even when I extended my education through a coding bootcamp, I still didn't really "learn" anything. Yes I received an education, but I didn't really learn. "What is the difference?" you might ask. Well there's a huge difference.
