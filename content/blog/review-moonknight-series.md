<h4 id='spoiler'>*** Spoiler Warning ***</h4>

### Twists & Turns
Moon Knight's episode one is the best opening in any marvel short series. You see the world through Steven's point of view throughout most of the episode. I love the scenes where he switches to another personality when he gets in trouble with Harrow's men. Every episode carefully lays details details for future episodes.

### Oscar's for Oscar
Oscar Isaac is my favorite part of this show. I would not care much for the show if he wasn't in it. He does a great job playing three different personalities to the point where I believe they are three different people. When Steven assumably dies in episode four, I believed a real person died and that was thanks to Oscar's awesome performance. I hope he receives some serious recognition for this performance. 

A lot of my friends expressed how annoyed they were with Steven because of his "goody good" and "boring" persona. I can see how his character can be boring or naive. But his character is completely necessary to the plot and the show does a great job depicting him in the first episode as if he's the main character. 

### Moon Knight is not about the Hero
Moon Knight hardly reveals the actual superhero of whom the show is named after. I wished to see more action with the actual superhero. The design of the costume and the power it held was awesome to see. I wish the show explained how his suit worked a little better. According to the comics he did not have any superhuman powers with that suit. In the series, he was literally stabbed multiple times with spears and it did not phase him.

I did not like Steven's version of the suit though. It just seemed like a clumsier version of Marc's suit. But it didn't bother me too much since he didn't really know what he was doing. I'm hoping Jake has his own suit as well, or if not, he just uses either of the two suits.

### Supporting characters
Ethan Hawke (Harrow) and May Calamawy (Layla) were great additions to the cast. They helped the plot move along well. From the beginning, Harrow was depicted as a manipulative cult leader, and he was consistent with that throughout the whole series. I was glad they were able to bring Layla in as a superhero as well. You could really tell that her suit was CGI even when it was dark, but it was an awesome suit nonetheless. 

### the Struggling Middle & Fight scenes
Where the show lost me was in the middle. Episodes 2, 3 and 4 were very bland. I didn't feel like the plot was moving too well. It felt like Marc was just chasing around ancient relics. The fight scenes were also mediocre. The worst fight was against the horsemen. The scene where Steven takes the body and then immediately gives it back to Marc because he was scared was an annoying scene to watch. All of the fight scenes that I wanted to watch were fast forwarded because they were assumably Jake taking over the body. I wish we would've seen at least one of those fights.

### Verdict
Episodes 1 & 5 were the show's saving grace. The end credit scene of the last episode was also one of the best end credit scenes I've scene. I love the total aspect of the show. There were only small annoyances here and there but overall, Moon Knight is Marvel's one of a kind. I recommend watching it, and if you're into the Marvel Universe, I recommend watching it multiple times.
