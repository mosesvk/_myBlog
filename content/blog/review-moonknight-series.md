### Twists & Turns
Moon Knight's episode one is the best opening in any marvel short series. You see the world through Steven's point of view throughout most of the episode. I love the scenes where he switches to another personality when he gets in trouble with Harrow's men. Every episode carefully lays details details for future episodes.

### Oscar's for Oscar
Oscar Isaac is my favorite part of this show. I would care much for the show if he wasn't it's center piece. I truly believe that Mark, Steven and Jake are completely different people.

### Education vs. Learning 
Going to University was a great experience for me. But none of that experience was beneficial to my learning. Even when I extended my education through a coding bootcamp, I still didn't really "learn" anything. Yes I received an education, but I didn't really learn. "What is the difference?" you might ask. Well there's a huge difference.
